You will be given two parameters\r\n<strong>width</strong> (odd number in range &lt5, 49 &gt) and <strong>height</strong> (number in range &lt5, 50 &gt). Based on these\r\ninputs you are required to draw a log cabin with a fence that will be <strong>width</strong> characters wide\r\nand <strong>height</strong> lines tall, the fence should always be 2 lines high with a supporting beam on each sides of the cabin.\r\nValid characters are <strong>x | = </strong>, each line needs to be exactly <strong>width</strong> characters wide (use spaces) and should be terminated with <strong>\\r\\n</strong>. \r\nTo make it a challenge, the goal is to build it as <strong>fast</strong> as possible.",
